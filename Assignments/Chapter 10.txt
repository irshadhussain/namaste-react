Q 1) Explore all the way of writting css -
And) There are 6 ways of wrtting css in the React -
     a) Normal css
     b) Sass/scss
     c) Inline css
     d) Css component library - Material UI, Base UI, Chakra UI and Ant UI
     e) Style component
     f) Tailwind Css - this is a new way of writting css


Q 2) How do we configure Tailwind ?
And) The configuration of Tailwind depends on the bundler what we are using - 
     For the Parcel bundler we have to do following -
     a) Install Tailwind NPM package & PostCSS
        npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
    b) Initialize the Tailwind / create Tailwind config file => tailwind.config.js
       npmx tailwindcss init => this command will create a new configuration file 

    c) Set tailwind configuration setting
        - We need to tail Tailwind which file need to consider or scan
        content: [
            "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
        ],

    d) Configure PostCSS
       - create a new PostCSS configuration file .postcssrc 
       - PostCSS, tail our bundler to compile Tailwind classes 

    e) Put 3 lines in the index.css
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;

        Tailwind also has different chunks so it devides his classes in above three categories


Q 3) In tailwind.config.js, what does all the keys mean (content, theme, extend, plugins) ?
Ans) Content - The content section is where you configure the paths to all of your HTML templates, 
     JS components, and any other files that contain Tailwind class names.

     Theme - The theme section is where you define your color palette, fonts, type scale, border sizes, 
     breakpoints — anything related to the visual design of your site.

     The theme object contains keys for screens, colors, and spacing, as well as a key for each customizable core plugin.
     The screens key allows you to customize the responsive breakpoints in your project.
     The colors key allows you to customize the global color palette for your project.
     The spacing key allows you to customize the global spacing and sizing scale for your project.

    Extend: This is a part of Theme object and this will allows you to customize the default theme.
    If you’d like to preserve the default values for a theme option but also add new values, add your 
    extensions under the extend key in the theme section of your configuration file.
     
    Plugin - The plugins section allows you to register plugins with Tailwind that can be used 
    to generate extra utilities, components, base styles, or custom variants.

    plugins: [
        require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
        require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio'),
        require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
        require('tailwindcss-children'),
    ]

Q 4) Why do we have .postcssrc file?
Ans) PostCSS configuration file tails our bundler that we are using tailwind plugins and compile tailwind css to normal css
